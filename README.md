# Discord-Bot
CC Bot

This is a bot for the popular chat app discord.

It will be an actively maintained project as I slowly add extra functionality to the bot

It will contain some functionality and metahumor. 

Currently will display latency to discord and stock price information. 

Add the bot to your server: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=684118827864293405&permissions=8&scope=bot

note: This bot is currently locally hosted so it will not be operational unless I am running on on my computer. I will update this when I have moved it to a cloud host.
